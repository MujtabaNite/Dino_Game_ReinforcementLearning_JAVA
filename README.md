# Chrome Dinosaur Game AI - Neural Evolution

A Java-based implementation using Processing that trains AI agents to play the Chrome Dinosaur game through **neuroevolution** - combining neural networks with genetic algorithms. This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can learn complex behaviors through simulated evolution, watching a population of dinosaurs evolve from random jumping to skilled obstacle avoidance.

## Overview

This project recreates the classic Chrome Dinosaur game and uses **genetic algorithms** to evolve neural networks that control the dinosaurs. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning approaches, this system mimics natural evolution where the best-performing dinosaurs pass their "genes" (neural network weights) to the next generation, with mutations and crossover creating new combinations.

Think of it like breeding race horses - we start with a random population, select the fastest runners, breed them together, and over many generations, the population becomes faster and more skilled. Here, our "horses" are dinosaurs, and their "speed" is their ability to avoid obstacles.

## Key Features

- **Complete Chrome Dino Game Recreation**: Full game implementation with physics, collision detection, and obstacle spawning
- **Neural Network Agents**: Each dinosaur has its own "brain" - a neural network that processes game state and makes decisions
- **Genetic Evolution**: Population evolves over generations through selection, crossover, and mutation
- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch both the game and the neural networks in action
- **Population Management**: Manages 100 dinosaurs per generation with intelligent breeding strategies
- **Performance Analytics**: Track evolution progress with detailed statistics and metrics

## How It Works

### The Learning Process

Instead of teaching one dinosaur how to play, we create 100 dinosaurs and let them learn through evolution:

1. **Initial Population**: 100 dinosaurs with random neural networks (they jump and crouch randomly)
2. **Natural Selection**: Let them play until they all die, measuring how long each survived
3. **Breeding**: The best performers get to "reproduce" - their neural networks are combined to create offspring
4. **Mutation**: Small random changes are made to prevent the population from becoming too similar
5. **New Generation**: The cycle repeats with a new population that's slightly better than the last

This process mirrors how biological evolution works, but accelerated into just a few minutes instead of millions of years.

### Neural Network Architecture

Each dinosaur has a neural network "brain" with three layers:

**Input Layer (7 neurons)** - The dinosaur's "senses":
- Distance to the next obstacle
- Obstacle's x and y position
- Obstacle width and height  
- Dinosaur's current vertical position
- Current game speed

**Hidden Layer (7 neurons)** - Processing and pattern recognition:
- Uses hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation function
- Processes sensory information into meaningful patterns
- Learns to recognize different obstacle types and situations

**Output Layer (2 neurons)** - Decision making:
- Jump decision (activates when output > 0.48)
- Crouch decision (activates when output > 0.55)
- Uses sigmoid activation for clear yes/no decisions

### Genetic Algorithm Components

**Selection Methods**:
- **Elite Selection**: Top 10% of performers automatically survive to breed
- **Tournament Selection**: Groups of 3 dinosaurs compete, winner gets to reproduce
- This ensures both preservation of good traits and genetic diversity

**Breeding Process**:
- 70% chance of crossover (mixing two parents' neural networks)
- 30% chance of copying one parent directly
- Offspring inherit combinations of their parents' decision-making abilities

**Mutation System**:
- Small random changes to neural network weights
- Prevents population from becoming too similar
- Allows discovery of new strategies
- Carefully balanced to avoid destroying good solutions
